# Project description

This is the repo of the final project on the course  [Planning algorithms in AI](https://github.com/planning-team/planning-2024-t2)

Here we provide:
- environment which models movement of 2-wheeled robot in the space with obstacles
- Q-learning[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) implementation, for solving RL problems

All the details can be viewed in the correspondong paper.

# Guide 
We provide supporting notebooks, how our Q-learning implementation can be used for the solving of [other environments](https://github.com/CorporalCleg/RobotQ/blob/main/robotq/supporting%20notebooks/frozenlake.ipynb) and [our one](https://github.com/CorporalCleg/RobotQ/blob/main/robotq/supporting%20notebooks/env.ipynb).
